# Turtle Data Exports
## Contents
The folder `/inst/reports` contains the exported data and data products from WAStD.
The files are split up by monitoring programs and contain:

* Raw data: CSV for text data, GeoJSON for spatial data.
* Reports: HTML files with interactive tables, maps, and figures.
* QA products: HTML reports prefixed by `qa_`.

## How to view
Note: the HTML file preview in Sharepoint is unsurprisingly broken. 
You may need to download (sync) the folder and view the files locally.

## How to edit
The files are a read-only snapshot of data living in WAStD. 
Please QA the data there.

## Currency
The contents of this folder are replaced after each data import to WAStD.
Contact the data custodian for any further questions.
